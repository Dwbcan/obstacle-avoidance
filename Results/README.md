In ***Real Image.jpg***, the makeshift ramp has a 20.4 degree angle of inclination, the cardboard box and paper towel roll represent tall obstacles with near 90 degree angles of inclination, and the ball of socks represents a "not-worrisome rock" of height 130 mm.

As seen in ***Detection Image.jpg***:

A part of the ball of socks is colored green because the pixels have heights between 100 and 150 mm while the rest of it is colored grey because the pixels have heights below 100 mm and can be considered "ground".

The cardboard box and paper towel roll are both colored red for the most part because of their high angles of inclination. The pixels at the bottoms of both of these objects are colored green or gray because they have heights either between 100 mm and 150 mm, or below 100 mm (in which case they are considered "ground").

The top of the makeshift ramp is colored yellow because the ramp has a slope 20.4 degree slope, meaning that it can be driven over with caution. The rest of the ramp is colored green or gray because the pixels have heights either between 100 mm and 150 mm, or below 100 mm (in which case they are considered "ground").
